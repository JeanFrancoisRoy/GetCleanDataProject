"activity": **activity_labels.txt** referenced file of the UCI HAR Dataset
"subject": subject id for test or train as referenced file of the UCI HAR Dataset

Features column are defined as the mean of the each group by activty and by subject. Which mean there is a unique set of activity-subject for each row. All other values are the mean of the group from the original data.
For more description on the features please refer to the **features_info.txt** of the UCI HAR Dataset.

The exact order is as follow:
"activity" "subject" "tBodyAcc-mean()-X" "tBodyAcc-mean()-Y" "tBodyAcc-mean()-Z" "tBodyAcc-std()-X" "tBodyAcc-std()-Y" "tBodyAcc-std()-Z" "tGravityAcc-mean()-X" "tGravityAcc-mean()-Y" "tGravityAcc-mean()-Z" "tGravityAcc-std()-X" "tGravityAcc-std()-Y" "tGravityAcc-std()-Z" "tBodyAccJerk-mean()-X" "tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Y" "tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Z" "tBodyAccJerk-std()-X" "tBodyAccJerk-std()-Y" "tBodyAccJerk-std()-Z" "tBodyGyro-mean()-X" "tBodyGyro-mean()-Y" "tBodyGyro-mean()-Z" "tBodyGyro-std()-X" "tBodyGyro-std()-Y" "tBodyGyro-std()-Z" "tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-X" "tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-Y" "tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-Z" "tBodyGyroJerk-std()-X" "tBodyGyroJerk-std()-Y" "tBodyGyroJerk-std()-Z" "tBodyAccMag-mean()" "tBodyAccMag-std()" "tGravityAccMag-mean()" "tGravityAccMag-std()" "tBodyAccJerkMag-mean()" "tBodyAccJerkMag-std()" "tBodyGyroMag-mean()" "tBodyGyroMag-std()" "tBodyGyroJerkMag-mean()" "tBodyGyroJerkMag-std()" "fBodyAcc-mean()-X" "fBodyAcc-mean()-Y" "fBodyAcc-mean()-Z" "fBodyAcc-std()-X" "fBodyAcc-std()-Y" "fBodyAcc-std()-Z" "fBodyAcc-meanFreq()-X" "fBodyAcc-meanFreq()-Y" "fBodyAcc-meanFreq()-Z" "fBodyAccJerk-mean()-X" "fBodyAccJerk-mean()-Y" "fBodyAccJerk-mean()-Z" "fBodyAccJerk-std()-X" "fBodyAccJerk-std()-Y" "fBodyAccJerk-std()-Z" "fBodyAccJerk-meanFreq()-X" "fBodyAccJerk-meanFreq()-Y" "fBodyAccJerk-meanFreq()-Z" "fBodyGyro-mean()-X" "fBodyGyro-mean()-Y" "fBodyGyro-mean()-Z" "fBodyGyro-std()-X" "fBodyGyro-std()-Y" "fBodyGyro-std()-Z" "fBodyGyro-meanFreq()-X" "fBodyGyro-meanFreq()-Y" "fBodyGyro-meanFreq()-Z" "fBodyAccMag-mean()" "fBodyAccMag-std()" "fBodyAccMag-meanFreq()" "fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-mean()" "fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-std()" "fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-meanFreq()" "fBodyBodyGyroMag-mean()" "fBodyBodyGyroMag-std()" "fBodyBodyGyroMag-meanFreq()" "fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-mean()" "fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-std()" "fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-meanFreq()"
